The Free energy principle has been offerd as a GUT of the brain. It is a theoretical framework that attempts to explain the
functioning of the brain in terms of a single principle: minimizing the free energy of a system. The free energy principle
is based on the idea that the brain is an inference machine that tries to minimize the difference between its internal model
of the world and the actual sensory input it receives. According to this principle, the brain is constantly trying to predict
the sensory input it will receive and minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual input. This process is
thought to underlie perception, action, and learning.

The free energy principle has been applied to a wide range of cognitive processes, including perception, action, attention, and
learning. It has also been used to explain the functioning of the brain at multiple levels of analysis, from the activity of
individual neurons to the behavior of large-scale brain networks. The free energy principle has been used to develop computational
models of brain function and to make predictions about how the brain will respond to different stimuli.

Free Energy is defined as:

    F = E - TS

    where F is the free energy, 
    E is the internal energy of the system, 
    T is the temperature of the system, 
    and S is the entropy of the system.

In terms of the brain the formla is more often wriiten as:

    F = D_KL(Q || P) + H(Q)

    where F is the free energy, 
    D_KL(Q || P) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the approximate posterior Q and the true posterior P, 
    and H(Q) is the entropy of the approximate posterior Q.

    Kullback-Leibler divergence is defined as the measure of how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution.
    Entropy is a measure of the uncertainty or disorder in a system.

# A siple algorithm to calculate the free energy of a system is as follows:
import numpy as np

def calculate_free_energy(energy, temperature, entropy):
    return energy - temperature * entropy

# Example usage:
internal_energy = 100
temperature = 0.5
entropy = 10

free_energy = calculate_free_energy(internal_energy, temperature, entropy)
print(f"Free energy of the system: {free_energy}")
