'''
The mean field model for a balanced network stats with N neurins both excittory and inhibitory wherein the 
Neurind recieve both exteranla and recurrent input. For the recurrent input each neuron recieves K excitatory and K inhibitory inputs.
K is assumed to be much smaller than N. 

                1 << K << N
